Project: - Assessing and Enhancing Property Quality Ratings

You’ve just purchased your dream home, but you’re unsure where to start with renovations. Should you focus on the kitchen, the bathrooms, or the living area? Perhaps you’re a homeowner looking to sell, and you wonder how the small changes you make will impact the property's value. These decisions are daunting, as the overall property quality impacts marketability and value perception. How can homeowners and buyers gain clarity on the improvements that matter most?
The problem lies in evaluating a property’s overall quality and determining which aspects influence its appeal the most. Features such as the number of rooms, bathrooms, living area size, and condition all impact a property’s perceived value. But homeowners and potential buyers often struggle to determine which improvements will most effectively boost the property’s quality score.
Goal: We aim to implement a model that assesses a property’s quality based on critical features. This model will not only provide a clear and objective quality rating but also deliver tailored recommendations for home improvements. By highlighting the areas that will most enhance the property’s perceived value, we help homeowners make decisions that ensure the greatest return on investment, improving their chances of a faster sale or increasing overall satisfaction with their home.
